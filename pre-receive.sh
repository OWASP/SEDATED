#### Script name: pre-receive.sh
#### Authored by: Dennis Kennedy and Simeon Cloutier
#### Description: The SEDATED pre-receive Git hook script used in conjunction with  
####              SEDATED's regexes (config/regexes.json), identifies added or modified     
####              lines of code being pushed to a Git instance that contain hard-coded  
####              credentials/sensitive data (as identified in config/regexes.json) and 
####              prevents the push IF lines containing hard-coded credentials/sensitive
####              data are found.
