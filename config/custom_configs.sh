#### Script name: custom_configs.sh
#### Authored by: Dennis Kennedy and Simeon Cloutier
#### Description: The SEDATED custom configurations file used in conjunction with 
####              pre-receive.sh allows organizations to customize their SEDATED  
####              implementation without having to modify any of the source code  
####              within SEDATED's pre-receive.sh script by providing built-in 
####              customizable variables and functions that are sourced by pre-receive.sh.
####              

######### Custom variables #########

# Show link to OWASP/SEDATED GitHub repository in message output
# If not set to "True" the link to OWASP/SEDATED will not be displayed
show_SEDATED_link_custom="True" # Set to "True" to display link to OWASP/SEDATED GitHub repository ! case-sensitive !

# This link will be displayed back to the developer when a push is rejected or when
# enforced repo check is set to true and the repo is not included on the enforced_repos_list.txt file
documentation_link_custom=""

# This (use_enforced_repo_check_custom) variable is required to be set to "True" or "False"
# When this (use_enforced_repo_check_custom) variable is set to "True":
### all repos not included in the config/enforced_repos_list.txt file will merely
### see the enforced_repo_check_true_message_custom and documentation_link_custom messages ouput
### SEDATED will only scan the code of the repos included in that list (config/enforced_repos_list.txt)
# If this (use_enforced_repo_check_custom) variable is set to "False":
### SEDATED will scan the code of every repo it is enabled on
use_enforced_repo_check_custom="" # Set to "True" or "False" ! case-sensitive !
enforced_repo_check_true_message_custom="SEDATED will soon be enforced on this repository..."
obfuscate_output_custom="True" # Set to "True" or "False"

######### Custom functions #########

# Sets user/org/group name variable as well as the repo name variable
# If using GitHub set variable names from GITHUB variable
# This function may need to adjusted based on implementation

# All functions listed below are optional, SEDATED already handles these cases,
# these custom functions allow organizations to customize their implementation
# of SEDATED by adding additional functionality upon the occurence of each of the
# below listed events. Some options are to print an additional message, log,
# or send a metric in a custom fashion.

# Take custom action when exiting

}

# This function will mask the value passed to it and store in a variable named $masked.
# The algorithm for the masking is as follows:
# If any of these characters " ='.-:+(){}", " is found, don't mask and restart counter. 
# Mask every 3rd and 4th character, and randomly every 2nd character.
